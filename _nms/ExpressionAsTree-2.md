title: "Expression as Tree (2 - Logic)"
sequence: "Expression as Tree"
Step: 2
StepTitle: "Logic"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative, OO
ConceptualAdvantage: "Makes explicit the fact that logic expressions have the same structural properties as the well known arithmetic expressions."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The structure, typing, and evaluation of expressions involving logic operators and Boolean literals."
UseWhen: "To reason about the structure and semantics of simple logic expressions."
Cost: "Small, can be done on paper or with a tool like Expression Tutor."
OriginSource: "Own practice"

Mapping:
  "...": "(all aspects from 1-Arithmetic)"
  "Boolean literal": "leaf tree node labeled with true or with false"
  "variable": "leaf tree node labeled with name of variable of type boolean"
  "unary negation operator (!)": "tree node with operator in front of a hole"
  "binary logical operator (|, &, ||, &&)": "tree node with operator between two holes"
Topic: "Expressions"

The following videos and activities come from [ExpressionTutor.org](https://expressiontutor.org/), where you can find a much more comprehensive set of resources and tools.
Expression Tutor supports many different programming languages,
but the material discussed here is specific to Java.

The [Crash Course: Expressions in Java](https://expressiontutor.org/course/JavaExpressionsCrashCourse/part/Part%202) provides a learning experience that corresponds to this notional machine sequence.
