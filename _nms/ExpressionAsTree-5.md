title: "Expression as Tree (4 - Comparisons & Conditionals)"
sequence: "Expression as Tree"
Step: 5
StepTitle: "Comparisons & Conditionals"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative, OO
ConceptualAdvantage: "Makes explicit the fact that comparisons are just expressions (they produce a boolean value), and that one can construct expressions with the ternary conditional operator (providing a boolean value as the first operand)."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The structure, typing, and evaluation of expressions involving comparisons and conditionals."
UseWhen: "When explaining comparisons (e.g., when introducing conditional statements and loops) and conditional expressions."
Cost: "Small, can be done on paper or with a tool like Expression Tutor."
OriginSource: "Own practice"

Mapping:
  "...": "(all aspects from 4-Arrays)"
  "binary comparison operator (==, !=, <, <=, >=, >)": "tree node with operator between two holes"
  "ternary conditional operator (?:)": "tree node with a hole for the condition, '?', a hole for the then-value, ':', and a hole for the else-value"
Topic: "Expressions"

The following videos and activities come from [ExpressionTutor.org](https://expressiontutor.org/), where you can find a much more comprehensive set of resources and tools.
Expression Tutor supports many different programming languages,
but the material discussed here is specific to Java.

The [Crash Course: Expressions in Java](https://expressiontutor.org/course/JavaExpressionsCrashCourse/part/Part%202) provides a learning experience that corresponds to this notional machine sequence.
