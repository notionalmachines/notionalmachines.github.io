title: Recursion Demo with Python Tutor
author: craig
ProgrammingLanguage: Python
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
Form: Representation
ConceptualAdvantage: "Demonstrates what happens to variable values when they are passed to a function. Distinguishes frame elements among each recursive call. Shows separate stack frames, each with own parameters and variables,
for each recursive call."
DrawsAttentionTo: Addition of each stack frame as each recursive call is made. Collapse of stack frame as function completes and returns value.
UseWhen: When introducing recursion
Cost: Requires use and understanding of the Python Tutor visualization tool
OriginSource: "Interview, Amber Settle"

Mapping:
  frame: "group of elements with function name"
  parameter: "labeled box inside frame"
  "local variable": "labeled box inside frame"
Topic: "Functions"

<p>
   Amber Settle presented this use of Python Tutor in an interview. She uses it to explain how recursive calls work when introducing recursion.

<h3>Notes from Interview</h3>
<p>
    From the interview: 
    Students "tend to use it a little bit mechanically so they tend to just step through 
    it and not really think about what's actually happening on the screen."
