title: Recursion Role Play
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: any
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: "Makes explicit recursive calls as a form to 'delegate' parts of work, base case as a situation where delegation stops. Allows unpacking many aspects of recursive computation (pairing of call/return, passing info down through params, up through return values, tail recursion)."
Form: Analogy
DrawsAttentionTo: "Recursive calls and returns, base case & recursive case, tail recursion"
UseWhen: "When introducing recursion (recursive computation over recursive data structure)."
Cost: "Difficult for instructor to react to students' actions during role-play, and to catch (and exploit) all the teachable moments. May require prior introduction of role-play (e.g., with 'Object as Student')."
OriginSource: "Own practice, Benedict DuBoulay"

Mapping:
  "object": "person"
  "method call": "verbal request to next person in line"
  "return value": "verbal response from next person in line"
  "base case": "(action of) last person in line"
  "recursive case": "(action of) all but last persons in line"
  "linked list": "line of persons (e.g., waiting in amusement park, or row in classroom)"
Topic: "Functions"

This notional machine is based on a suggestion by Benedict DuBoulay at EC-TEL 2016.

Matthias Hauswirth used this to introduce recursion in an object-oriented programming course.
