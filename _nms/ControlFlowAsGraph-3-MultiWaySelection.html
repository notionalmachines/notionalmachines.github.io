title: Control Flow as Graph (3 - Multi-Way Selection)
sequence: "Control Flow as Graph"
Step: 3
StepTitle: "Multi-Way Selection"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: "Understand concept of a multi-way selection (a conditional statement where the condition is not just a Boolean value, e.g., a switch-statement)."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The idea of a multi-way 'selection' in structured programming, where a data (the condition's value) is turned into control flow (the next statement to execute)."
UseWhen: "When introducing switch-statements"
Cost: "Requires prior introduction of 'Selection'."
OriginSource: "Compilers (control-flow graphs) and flow charts"
image: ControlFlowAsGraph-3-MultiWaySelection.jpg
Mapping:
  "...": "..."
  "switch condition": "diamond-shaped node with multiple arrows leaving"
  "switch cases": "label on arrows coming out of a switch (including 'default')"
Topic: "ControlFlow"

    This notional machine is implemented by the Informa Clicker tool.
    This tool allows students in a classroom to construct control flow graphs
    in in-class clicker exercises.
