The following videos and activities come from [ExpressionTutor.org](https://expressiontutor.org/), where you can find a much more comprehensive set of resources and tools.
Expression Tutor supports many different programming languages,
but the material discussed here is specific to Java.

The [Crash Course: Expressions in Java](https://expressiontutor.org/course/JavaExpressionsCrashCourse/part/Part%202) provides a learning experience that corresponds to this notional machine sequence.
