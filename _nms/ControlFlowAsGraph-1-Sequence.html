title: Control Flow as Graph (1 - Sequence)
sequence: "Control Flow as Graph"
Step: 1
StepTitle: "Sequence"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: "See a method as a sequence of statements to execute, and make clear that that sequence starts when the method is called and ends when the method returns."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The idea of a 'sequence' in structured programming, where a sequence consists of statements to execute."
UseWhen: "When introducing how to implement a method's body"
Cost: "Introduction of a potentially new abstract representation (graph with edges and nodes). Entry and exit nodes, which do not correspond to statements in the source code (note: exit comes AFTER a possible return statement)."
OriginSource: "Compilers (control-flow graphs) and flow charts"
image: ControlFlowAsGraph-1-Sequence.jpg
Mapping:
  "statement": "rectangular node"
  "control-flow between statements": "arrow from node to node"
  "method entry": "round 'e' node at top"
  "method exit": "round 'x' node at bottom"
Topic: "ControlFlow"

    The following video Matthias Hauswirth uses the "Control Flow as Graph"
    notional machine in his "Programming Fundamentals 2" Bachelor course
    to explain sequences of statements as well as the entry and exit node in Java.
    It also discusses <code>if</code>-statements 
    (covered in the <a href="ControlFlowAsGraph-2-Selection.html">Selection</a> variant of this notional machine).

<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>
    This notional machine is implemented by the Informa Clicker tool.
    This tool allows students in a classroom to construct control flow graphs
    in in-class clicker exercises.
