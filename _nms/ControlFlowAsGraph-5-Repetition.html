title: Control Flow as Graph (5 - Repetition)
sequence: "Control Flow as Graph"
Step: 5
StepTitle: "Repetition"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: "Understand concept of repetition from structured programming (loops like while, do-while, or for), where a given statement can be executed multiple times, by simply following the arrows through the cycle."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The idea of a 'repetition' in structured programming, where control-flow leads to statements getting executed multiple times"
UseWhen: "When introducing while-, do-while-, and for-loops"
Cost: "Requires prior introduction of 'Selection'."
OriginSource: "Compilers (control-flow graphs) and flow charts"
image: ControlFlowAsGraph-5-Repetition.jpg
Mapping:
  "...": "..."
  "back edge": "arrow pointing to a node that came prior in the flow (introducing a cycle)"
  "while-, do-while-, for-loop": "cycle in the graph"
Topic: "ControlFlow"

    The following video Matthias Hauswirth uses the "Control Flow as Graph"
    notional machine in his "Programming Fundamentals 2" Bachelor course
    to explain <code>for</code>-loops in Java:

<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>
    This notional machine is implemented by the Informa Clicker tool.
    This tool allows students in a classroom to construct control flow graphs
    in in-class clicker exercises.
