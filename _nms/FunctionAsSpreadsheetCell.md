title: Function as Spreadsheet Cell
author: johan
ProgrammingLanguage: any
ProgrammingParadigm: any
ConceptualAdvantage: "The spreadsheet shows how input is transferred to output in several steps. It shows the core of the functionality that students need to implement. It allows students to experiment with changing input and functionality, and it provides students test cases."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "It shows the students how output depends on input and calculation. It shows the different steps in the calculation."
UseWhen: "This is used when students start implementing their first slightly larger software system (an information retrieval system)."
Cost: "Creating such a spreadsheet is usually half a day to a day's work. Students appreciate it, but it involves a different computation paradigm than the programming language the students learn in the course."
OriginSource: "Interview; used by Frans Wiering, source Roelof van Zwol in a course at Utrecht University in 2005."
