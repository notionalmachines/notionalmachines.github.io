title: Control Flow as Graph (2 - Selection)
sequence: "Control Flow as Graph"
Step: 2
StepTitle: "Selection"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: "Understand concept of selection from structured programming (conditional statements like if, if-else), and make clear that a statement may or may not execute, based on a decision taken earlier in the control flow."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The idea of a 'selection' in structured programming, where a data (the condition's value) is turned into control flow (the next statement to execute)."
UseWhen: "When introducing if-statements"
Cost: "Requires prior introduction of 'Sequence'. Mismatch for short-circuit operators (&&, ||) or conditional expressions (c ? a : b), which don't map as naturally."
OriginSource: "Compilers (control-flow graphs) and flow charts"
image: ControlFlowAsGraph-2-Selection.jpg
Mapping:
  "...": "..."
  "if condition": "diamond-shaped node"
  "condition outcome": "label on an arrow coming out of a condition (e.g., true, false)"

    The following video Matthias Hauswirth uses the "Control Flow as Graph"
    notional machine in his "Programming Fundamentals 2" Bachelor course
    to explain <code>if</code>-statements in Java:

<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>
    This notional machine is implemented by the Informa Clicker tool.
    This tool allows students in a classroom to construct control flow graphs
    in in-class clicker exercises.
