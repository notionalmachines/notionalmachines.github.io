title: Control Flow as Graph (4 - Short-Circuit)
sequence: "Control Flow as Graph"
Step: 4
StepTitle: "Short-Circuit"
author: matthias
ProgrammingLanguage: Java
ProgrammingParadigm: imperative
ConceptualAdvantage: "Understand concept of short-circuit Boolean operators  (|| and &&), and see how they only evaluate their right operand if needed."
Form: Representation
DrawsAttentionTo: "The idea that for short-circuit Boolean operators, the second operand may never be evaluated (allowing common constructs like if (o!=null && o.length>0) ..."
UseWhen: "When introducing short-circuit operators && and ||"
Cost: "Requires prior introduction of 'Selection'."
OriginSource: "Compilers (control-flow graphs) and flow charts"

Mapping:
  "...": "..."
  "|| in condition": "'false' arrow to extra diamond node"
  "&& in condition": "'true' arrow to extra diamond node"

<p>
    This notional machine is implemented by the Informa Clicker tool.
    This tool allows students in a classroom to construct control flow graphs
    in in-class clicker exercises.
